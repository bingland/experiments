# experiments
A repo for doing small experiments for self learning purposes.

## Ideas
* Load in assets (like HD video) before launching app. Loading screen.
* Making a lottie animation, maybe with Haiku Animator
* Doing fancy buttons with animations. Use Pinterest for inspiration.
* Making a dark theme for a site. Switch between themes instantly. [Article link](https://medium.com/@katiemctigue/how-to-create-a-dark-mode-in-sass-609f131a3995)
* Make a full page application based of off Pinterest inspiration, or design your own.
* Making something with Three.js
* Resource for Esperanto reading, speakers, listening, etc
* Chrome Extension - BetterTTV for YouTube chat
* Some kind of Socket IO app - game for Twitch using emotes?
